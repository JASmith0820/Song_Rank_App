You can view our published R Shiny application at https://jasmith0820.shinyapps.io/Song_Rank_App

You can also recreate the steps used to create the Shiny app by completing the following:  
1) Download all files to your working directory.  
2) Run the Python code entitled 1_Web_Scraping_and_File_Creation.py. This will create several csv files in your working directory.  
3) Run the R code entitled 2_Plot_the_Data.R.  
4) Ensure that you have the Shiny library installed.  
5) In R, run the code "library(shiny)" and then "runApp()".  
6) This will create the R Shiny application in a new window.
